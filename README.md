# Welcome to Music-Generator!
## Music generator is a solo project by Carson Reeder. 
The goal for this web app is to:
- generate chords indepedently or in a progression using AI or in the future potentially using a program as the AI response time is long
- allow the user to playback the chords in a progression
- allow the user to rearrange the order, length, and position of the chords, essentially allowing the user to create music.

Known Bugs:
- Load the page and create 2 extra measures. Delete the first measure. Now when trying to move chords, they are bugged and dragging on measure 2 moves the chords on measure 1.
  This obviously has something to do with me changing the id after removing a measure and how the measures are rendered
